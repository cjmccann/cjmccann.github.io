	<h1> Connor McCann </h1>
	<h2> Los Angeleno,  Tufts Student, Legend </h2>

	<p> Hi there. I'm Connor McCann, and as the subtitle says, I'm a Tufts student from Los Angeles. My major is Clinical Psychology, and minor is Computer Science. I recently redirected myself to focus much more on CS; I love the challenges of programming, and I want to be a Software Developer. </p>

	<p> I am a borderline rabid Dodgers fan, and I count down the number of days until Opening Day. I play baseball at Tufts, but only semi-seriously (club team). If you're a Giants fan, I WILL FIGHT YOU. </p>

	<p> In the Spring of '13 I studied abroad in Madrid, and I loved every minute of being abroad, traveling, and living another life. While I was there, I studied art in the Prado, the European Union, and Spanish Poetry. I'd like to continue trying to live in different cities for a long time. </p>
