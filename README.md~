1. All aspects fully implemented
	-> Would do some restructuring of resume, but do not have time
	-> Polishing index.html page on to-do list as well
	->index.html landing page functional, with links to resume and bio
	->resume.html and bio.html pages are live
	->all html have css files as well
2. Samuel Daniel. Before the assignment was posted he had previously helped me make a github.io branch and display an index.html page that just contained "hello world"
3. Approx. 3 hours. Translating resume into HTML took the longest
