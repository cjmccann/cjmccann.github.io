<h3>Inroduction</h3>
<p>
Welcome to Germinate. Your goal as an ambitious young tree in the world is to survive and spread your seed, and to do so as efficiently as possible. You must decide how to grow yourself -- spending water and sugar to create more branches and roots. These limbs in turn give you greater intake of water and the ability to make more sugar. When you have enough sugar and water you can do what you were put on this good earth to do -- GERMINATE. But be careful for vicious sapling-eating spiders...you must also keep some of resources around to fend off these nasty pests. 
</p>
<h4>Game Mechanics and Controls</h4>
<p>
As alluded to, the object of the game is to accumulate the required amounts of water and sugar to germinate and to do so as fast as possible and with losing as little health as possible. Status bars at the top of the screen will indicate your supplies of sugar, water, and your current health. If your health manages to drop to zero, you lose the game.

<p> 
You must also spend resources to buy branches, roots, and use the harden ability. Roots cost water to be made, and branches cost sugars. The more branches you have, the greater your sugar production per second, and the same goes for water. However, be aware of diminishing returns. The harden ability prevents spiders from attacking your tree, and will repel the invaders backwards. It costs both water and sugar for as long as harden is activated - use it sparingly.
</p>
<h5>Winning Condition</h5> 
<p>
When you have full bars of both water and suger you are able to germinate, thus ending the game. While this is winning the game, the true purpose of Germinate is to acheive a high score. Your score is calculated based on how much time it took for you to germinate, and how much health you lost. The faster you can do it, and the more health you have saved from the spiders, the better your score.
